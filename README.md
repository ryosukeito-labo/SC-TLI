# SC-TLI (Structurally Coupled Time-Lapse Inversion)

**SC-TLI (Structurally Coupled Time-Lapse Inversion)** is a novel inversion framework for time-lapse magnetic data that integrates spatial L1–L2 regularization with temporal structural coupling.

This repository contains the implementation used in the accompanying manuscript (currently under submission), including synthetic experiments and model datasets.

## 📌 Status

⚠️ **Under submission**

This repository is currently synchronized with a manuscript that is under review.
The code and datasets are provided for transparency and reproducibility, but **please do not use or cite this work until the paper is officially published**.

The repository will be updated and fully released upon acceptance.

## 📖 Method Overview

The SC-TLI method solves the following optimization problem:

$$
P(\mathbf{\beta}) =
\lambda_s \left( \alpha \left\| \mathbf{\beta} \right\|_1 + \frac{1-\alpha}{2} \left\| \boldsymbol{\beta} \right\|_2^2 \right)
+
\lambda_t \sum_{\mathcal{G}_j} \left\| (D\boldsymbol{\beta})_{\mathcal{G}_j} \right\|_2
$$

* **Spatial regularization**: L1-L2 penalty (Utsugi, 2019; Ito and Utsugi, 2025)
* **Temporal regularization**: Group Lasso penalty on time differences
* **Optimization**: ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers; Boyd et al., 2011)

This formulation enables:

* Sparse and stable spatial inversion
* Structural consistency across time steps
* Robust estimation under noisy conditions
